5.0,4 July 2025,"The Quality of headphones and Aux cable is really good. Noise cancellation is fantastic, After putting it on you are on the own world of yours. Dual Pairing makes the headphone accessible to use in 2 devices at the same time. The battery life is also very long, you charge yours headphones fully and not worry about it for a week. The ear pads or cushion part is not convertible means you cannot fold or turn them around like other headphones but that is not my concerns cause I can use them without it still. Overall they are easy, can be used in 2 devices at the same time (both device bluetooth not wired + bluetooth), comfortable to wear, looks aesthetic and will not let you down."
1.0,25 January 2024,"I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS. These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.

Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic ‚Äì that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.

Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).

So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.

For those seeking a more constructive alternative:

Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.
Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.
Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.
Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares."
4.0,14 September 2025,"Headphones are fine with long battery backup, good build quality, you will not regret purchasing. It has good audio quality and latency, but if you are gaming or doing task like video editing especially music synchronisation you should try wired option as you can feel the latency which is the common issue for all wireless modes until you buy expensive ones. The mic quality is also good with noise filtering. It only lacks in the audio codec ( how it recieve audio from device ) which is sbc that is the least one in the spectrum, this means the audio quality is not great."

From sending the product to noise team and receiving to you back they take 15 days. And I lost whole 2 months only to do this process.

3.0,22 August 2025,Average product not comfortable but good audio quality
4.0,3 October 2023,"I've had my headphones for a while now, and I'd like to share my thoughts on them. Let's start with the not-so-great aspects:

‚ñ°Bad Qualities ‚ñ°
1. Defective Headphone
From day one, I noticed a significant issue with the right side of my headphones. When I turn the volume up to the maximum or above the recommended level, it starts making loud and disturbing noises like ""zzz zzz"" alongside the audio I'm listening to. This makes it quite challenging to understand what's being played. Fortunately, I usually keep the volume at a moderate level, so it's manageable for me. I considered getting them replaced, but the reputation of noise company' poor customer service discouraged me..

2. Sound leakage: Another downside is that when I crank up the volume, people around me can hear what I'm listening to through my headphones, which can be a bit embarrassing in public spaces.

Now, let's talk about the positive aspects:

‚òÜGood Qualities‚òÜ
1. Impressive Battery Life: Charging these headphones for just one hour lasts me almost an entire week, which is incredibly convenient.

2. Excellent Sound Quality: At the recommended volume levels, the sound quality is fantastic, providing a rich and immersive listening experience.

3. Noise Isolation: These headphones do an excellent job of isolating external noise, making it possible for me to enjoy my music even in crowded places like Mumbai local trains.

4. Stylish Design: I must say these headphones look good. They have a sleek and modern design that complements my style.

5. Comfortable Fit: They are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, which is perfect for long commutes or extended listening sessions.

6. Easy Controls: The buttons on these headphones are well-placed and easy to access, allowing me to control playback and adjust the volume without needing to touch my phone.

In summary, my headphone experience has been a mixed. While they have some drawbacks, such as the defective right side and sound leakage at high volumes, the positive aspects like long battery life, excellent sound quality, and comfort make them a decent choice for daily use.

I would recommend these headphones, especially for students. They offer excellent comfort, making them suitable for attending 6-7 hour long online lectures or studying online for extended periods. Additionally, they are quite durable, which makes them a good choice for working professionals. However, if you encounter a defective unit like I did, consider getting it replaced. It's also essential to be aware that the ""Noise"" company is known for its poor customer service, so keep that in mind before making a purchase decision."

5.0,11 July 2025,"üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Surprisingly Impressive! Noise Two Delivers on Every Front!

I recently bought the Noise Two Wireless On-Ear Headphones (Serene Blue) and I‚Äôm honestly blown away by how much value they offer for the price. Here‚Äôs what makes them a 5-star product for me:

üéß Comfort &amp; Style: The Serene Blue color is gorgeous ‚Äî subtle yet stylish. The on-ear design is lightweight and fits comfortably for long listening sessions without causing fatigue.

üîã Massive 50-Hour Battery Life: I‚Äôve been using them regularly for over a week, and I still haven‚Äôt had to charge them again! This kind of battery backup is a game-changer, especially for travel or work-from-home.

‚ö° Low Latency Mode (40ms): Perfect for gamers or watching content ‚Äî audio stays in sync with the visuals. I noticed zero lag while streaming videos or playing games on my phone.

üéµ 4 Play Modes: Whether it‚Äôs Bass Mode for music, Balanced Mode for calls, or Gaming Mode, switching between modes is smooth and really changes the experience. Great customization!

üîÅ Dual Pairing + BT v5.3: Super handy! I‚Äôve paired these with both my laptop and phone at the same time. Switching devices is seamless, and the Bluetooth 5.3 connection is rock solid ‚Äî no drops or stutters.

üé§ Clear Call Quality: The built-in mic picks up voice clearly even in slightly noisy environments. I‚Äôve taken multiple calls on these, and no one has complained.

In short, the Noise Two headphones deliver exceptional sound, long battery life, and modern features without breaking the bank. Whether you're a casual listener, student, or someone working from home ‚Äî you won‚Äôt regret this buy! üëåüé∂"

The voice and sound quality is amazing, it's almost noise cancelling, and is worth the money for sure, it has a sleek finish and the buttons on the side are quite accessible. The mic quality although could've been improved as the voice isn't clear when we speak with the in-built mic of the headphones."

4.0,10 October 2023,"I've been using this headphone since last 2 months approx. So from the start the box of headphones consist of headphones type c charger and aux. And from my use since last two months I can definitely say that this headphones are value for money. Like I use them for gym, online classes and for gaming too and they provide really nice sound quality with dual pairing mode. About the battery backup it's insane like if I charge them 100% then i don't need to charge them for another 3 4 days and it get charged really quick. Then about comfort I have to give it 7/10 they are good in other ways but when i wear it for like more than 2 or 3 hours my ears start to ache it's painfull sometimes but about looks it's solid 10/10 they look insanely good if you are buying for gym or any sport purpose this headphone are really good. In the aux mode it gives problem sometimes. It even have slot for SD card. I haven't use that yet so can't tell about that anything. But in this price range if you are confuse between boat rockerz 450 and this headphones I'll suggest you should go with this headphones. Overall this headphones are value for money (‚Çπ1699). If this headphones are in stock but price is more than 2000rs I think you should go with another options cause this headphones are not worth more than 1700rs i bought them because they were for 1699 and this colour is the only colour that looks good in this headphones. And about sound the most important thing it's not that good and it's not that bad on a scale it is 8/10 so overall rating is 9/10"
3.0,10 June 2025,Uncomfortable
5.0,18 October 2023,"In one word,  good ""VALUE FOR MONEY"". Bye bye.

For those who want all goods and bads here they are:

1. Build Quality
  a. On Ear headphones (not over ear headphones)
  b. Lighter overall weight than its competitors (187 grams)
  c. Neither too Sturdy not too Flimsy
  d. Foldable (earcups)
  e. Chance for fingerprint attraction
  f. Very precisely fits my beefy head
  g. Ear cups are soft and will suit if u have average sized ears
  h. Matte finish (surface is not reflective)
  i. Fit on my ears is rather small and its not as good as over head earphones.

2. Sound Quality
  a. Great Noise Cancellation for this price
  b. Volume can get pretty loud
  c. Heavy Audio leakage
  d. Great Bass
  e. Mids are decent

3. Ports &amp; Buttons
  a. USB -  C charging port
  b. 3.5mm headphone Jack
  c. SD Card slot that supports my 32GB Sandisk
  d. Tactical buttons usable for almost all media controls including voice assistant

4. One Year Warranty card which u should claim

5. Battery life good lasted me 5 days for a power user like me

6. Audio Quality is great - Very balanced instead of fancy stuff like Bass boosted, etc. Thus giving user the control to equalize their songs.

7. Bluetooth Connectivity is alright, only once out of a week did it struggle to connect to my phone but still whenever I turn on my bluetooth pairs up quickly.

8. Take occassional breaks while using this as earcups are big enough to cover the hollow parts of your ear at the same time fitting perfectly on top of my skeletal structures thus creating pain with continous usage."
5.0,6 September 2025,Very good sound very nice voice
2.0,30 August 2025,"I bought noise 2 and its build quality is worse, it broke while adjusting to my head üò§. But the sound quality is good"
5.0,23 August 2025,Its too good i like it because in headphones there fm memory and with aux and Bluetooth compulsory but i will the quality of sound and the worthy not a waste of money
2.0,18 August 2025,"Stupid headphones and brand,  I've just use this headphones for 3 months, it already stopped working, it's power button , volume buttons, stopped working , I even tried to file a complaint, but it's not submitting"
4.0,2 June 2025,All functions working
3.0,6 May 2025,Headphones are good sound and call quality is clear and comfortable for wear for long hours. Build quality needs to be improvement and the earcup needs more cushioning.
5.0,26 August 2025,"For the price range, the best quality headphone you could ever get. Trust me, it will be a good investment"
5.0,28 August 2025,Nice .. working perfectly after approx 2years of use.. FM playing is somewhat tricky..but perfect
4.0,10 February 2024,
4.0,6 March 2025,"i thing its the best in its price....... Awesome product . verified purchase but one thing that I may complain is that you can't use it continuously for more that 2 hours as your ears start to pain and make discomfort.
design good
mic quality ok ok
sound quality good at 60 - 70 % volume at 100% volume there is leakage of sound
weight distribution is good but it is not water resistant so make a distance with water"
4.0,26 May 2025,Mic not good
4.0,28 January 2024,"So, I got these headphones delivered 3 days ago and I have been using them 5hours everyday since then. Here are my views-
1.The build quality is decent. But, there are marks of My fingerprints on body. Also, the cushions are really good and these headphones are on ear not over ears one.
2. Battery life has been decent and due to type c port availability, it charges at decent speed.
3. Talking about comfort so my head and ears are big so these are not very comfortable but you can still wear them for around 1 hour and take break of 10 min after that. It is I think mainly designed for small ears.
4. Now, sound quality and bass has been very solid for this price range.
5. The biggest concern is noise leaking. After 50% you cannot go without making someone who is near you listen the song you are listening but for online classes and shows, voice leaking starts at 60-65%.
Overall, these are decent headphones not for someone like me who has big ears, and if you want to purchase headphones without noise leaking then go with any other brand than noise.
Forgot to mention that the quality of mic is okish and needs improving and sound canceling and anc is decent too not best.
If you are getting a deal for 1300 or 1500 then purchase these.
üëã bye"

4.0,16 July 2024,"I did purchased this earphone, and I love the bluetooth range, and I love earphone and the sound. At last, I have to return the product due to some defects, which I wish it's not there.

The functionality and sound and everything else is good, except, there's some part moving inside the right ear cup. May be loose speaker. When I move my head wearing it, it moves and give a grinding sound, and since it's on the ear, it's very loud. It's a manufacturing defect (of course) but not electronically.

I want a replacement, but they can't do that, and I have the option for refund only.

I still want it now also, but I get another brand, instead. I believe that's an isolated incident. Go for it."

4.0,21 December 2023,"really liked the design but there is so much noise leakage
Edit - this is my review after 1.5 years sound is good in a noisy environment you may want it to be a bit louder and big issue was noise leakage at max volume however i wanted it for gym so it was fine because gym noise cancels the leakage . bought it for 1700 ig now it‚Äôs for 1300 which is a steal they look good sound good easy to carry and crazy battery life just charge and forget. also one side stopped working in just 2-3 months so i called the customer service and they repaired it free of cost no questions asked as it was in warranty but you may want to consider that and biggest issue was the build quality after 6-7 months one of the hinge got broken so i glued it but after another 7 months other side of headphone gave a big crack out of nowhere which isn‚Äôt repair able so they are no more ,one thing for sure they won‚Äôt last you more than a year"

2.0,6 August 2025,It's heavy. Not comfortable
3.0,9 December 2023,"1. Sound quality is good.
2. Bass quality is also good.
3. Battery backup is superb.
4. Charging is also fast (not too fast but yeah, fast) and type-C port is a good addition.
5. Buttons are tactile and good so you won't have any problems with that.
6. Matte finish on the surface feels premium but it gets fingerprint smudges so try to keep it clean.
7. SD-card slot and aux support is appreciable.
8. Not durable because it is completely built with plastic, a little amount of metal is used at sides (under elongated part) so if you sleep while wearing it, then only God can save it.
9. After sometime, the points from where it collapses/folds gets loosened up, and you won't be able to jog while wearing it because of its loose fitting.
10. It is a good option at Rs. 1500, if its priced higher then look for other options."

It is too loud though, the lowest volume is not low enough. Treble is quite good but bass frequencies have issues. Comfort-wise it beats even high-end headphones. I am a sucker for light-weight headphones and these are the second-lightest ones I have ever worn. The ear cups are fine as well. They could have made them broader and this would have had the over-ear name. It also cancels a bit of noise physically. No ANC of course. I was about to return it after the first day but kept it anyway and don't regret. Good little headphones."

4.0,16 November 2022,"Decent headphone. You will not go wrong with this.Not recommended for hot weather or if you ear sweat a lot.
Else recommended for the price. I purchased at 1.5K

Sound quality is good. Very good for listening to YouTube videos, movies etc. Also good for songs.

(Edit: after 2 weeks use)
Tested in iPhone 14 Pro, Redmi K20 Pro, and my PC (aux cable). Everything works totally fine.
Haven't tried SD card playback (I don't need to).
Related to calls (didn't test), i do not prefer over the ear headphones for calls, so i have a alternative neckband for calls. So can't comment on that.

But i would recommend not to go with white like me. This is like pure white. So any small dirt or scratch will get noticed easily. Go for darker colours unless white is necessary.

Build is nice and doesn't feel cheap.

honestly very good deal for 1.5K not gonna lie.

And let me be super clear, this is NOT A BIASED or paid REVIEW. Pure based on usage."

So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.

For those seeking a more constructive alternative:

Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.
Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.
Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.
Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares."
4.0,14 September 2025,"Headphones are fine with long battery backup, good build quality, you will not regret purchasing. It has good audio quality and latency, but if you are gaming or doing task like video editing especially music synchronisation you should try wired option as you can feel the latency which is the common issue for all wireless modes until you buy expensive ones. The mic quality is also good with noise filtering. It only lacks in the audio codec ( how it recieve audio from device ) which is sbc that is the least one in the spectrum, this means the audio quality is not great."
5.0,9 September 2025,Product have good sound along with value for money. Comfortable and durable

From sending the product to noise team and receiving to you back they take 15 days. And I lost whole 2 months only to do this process.
This product dont have proper bluetooth connection doesn't charge properly and waste of money and time.

3.0,22 August 2025,Average product not comfortable but good audio quality
4.0,3 October 2023,"I've had my headphones for a while now, and I'd like to share my thoughts on them. Let's start with the not-so-great aspects:

‚ñ°Bad Qualities ‚ñ°
1. Defective Headphone
From day one, I noticed a significant issue with the right side of my headphones. When I turn the volume up to the maximum or above the recommended level, it starts making loud and disturbing noises like ""zzz zzz"" alongside the audio I'm listening to. This makes it quite challenging to understand what's being played. Fortunately, I usually keep the volume at a moderate level, so it's manageable for me. I considered getting them replaced, but the reputation of noise company' poor customer service discouraged me..

2. Sound leakage: Another downside is that when I crank up the volume, people around me can hear what I'm listening to through my headphones, which can be a bit embarrassing in public spaces.

Now, let's talk about the positive aspects:

‚òÜGood Qualities‚òÜ
1. Impressive Battery Life: Charging these headphones for just one hour lasts me almost an entire week, which is incredibly convenient.

2. Excellent Sound Quality: At the recommended volume levels, the sound quality is fantastic, providing a rich and immersive listening experience.

3. Noise Isolation: These headphones do an excellent job of isolating external noise, making it possible for me to enjoy my music even in crowded places like Mumbai local trains.

4. Stylish Design: I must say these headphones look good. They have a sleek and modern design that complements my style.

5. Comfortable Fit: They are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods, which is perfect for long commutes or extended listening sessions.

6. Easy Controls: The buttons on these headphones are well-placed and easy to access, allowing me to control playback and adjust the volume without needing to touch my phone.

In summary, my headphone experience has been a mixed. While they have some drawbacks, such as the defective right side and sound leakage at high volumes, the positive aspects like long battery life, excellent sound quality, and comfort make them a decent choice for daily use.

I would recommend these headphones, especially for students. They offer excellent comfort, making them suitable for attending 6-7 hour long online lectures or studying online for extended periods. Additionally, they are quite durable, which makes them a good choice for working professionals. However, if you encounter a defective unit like I did, consider getting it replaced. It's also essential to be aware that the ""Noise"" company is known for its poor customer service, so keep that in mind before making a purchase decision."

5.0,11 July 2025,"üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Surprisingly Impressive! Noise Two Delivers on Every Front!

I recently bought the Noise Two Wireless On-Ear Headphones (Serene Blue) and I‚Äôm honestly blown away by how much value they offer for the price. Here‚Äôs what makes them a 5-star product for me:

The voice and sound quality is amazing, it's almost noise cancelling, and is worth the money for sure, it has a sleek finish and the buttons on the side are quite accessible. The mic quality although could've been improved as the voice isn't clear when we speak with the in-built mic of the headphones."

4.0,10 October 2023,"I've been using this headphone since last 2 months approx. So from the start the box of headphones consist of headphones type c charger and aux. And from my use since last two months I can definitely say that this headphones are value for money. Like I use them for gym, online classes and for gaming too and they provide really nice sound quality with dual pairing mode. About the battery backup it's insane like if I charge them 100% then i don't need to charge them for another 3 4 days and it get charged really quick. Then about comfort I have to give it 7/10 they are good in other ways but when i wear it for like more than 2 or 3 hours my ears start to ache it's painfull sometimes but about looks it's solid 10/10 they look insanely good if you are buying for gym or any sport purpose this headphone are really good. In the aux mode it gives problem sometimes. It even have slot for SD card. I haven't use that yet so can't tell about that anything. But in this price range if you are confuse between boat rockerz 450 and this headphones I'll suggest you should go with this headphones. Overall this headphones are value for money (‚Çπ1699). If this headphones are in stock but price is more than 2000rs I think you should go with another options cause this headphones are not worth more than 1700rs i bought them because they were for 1699 and this colour is the only colour that looks good in this headphones. And about sound the most important thing it's not that good and it's not that bad on a scale it is 8/10 so overall rating is 9/10"
3.0,10 June 2025,Uncomfortable
5.0,18 October 2023,"In one word,  good ""VALUE FOR MONEY"". Bye bye.

For those who want all goods and bads here they are:

1. Build Quality
  a. On Ear headphones (not over ear headphones)
  b. Lighter overall weight than its competitors (187 grams)
  c. Neither too Sturdy not too Flimsy
  d. Foldable (earcups)
  e. Chance for fingerprint attraction
  f. Very precisely fits my beefy head
  g. Ear cups are soft and will suit if u have average sized ears
  h. Matte finish (surface is not reflective)
  i. Fit on my ears is rather small and its not as good as over head earphones.

2. Sound Quality
  a. Great Noise Cancellation for this price
  b. Volume can get pretty loud
  c. Heavy Audio leakage
  d. Great Bass
  e. Mids are decent

3. Ports &amp; Buttons
  a. USB -  C charging port
  b. 3.5mm headphone Jack
  c. SD Card slot that supports my 32GB Sandisk
  d. Tactical buttons usable for almost all media controls including voice assistant

4. One Year Warranty card which u should claim

5. Battery life good lasted me 5 days for a power user like me

6. Audio Quality is great - Very balanced instead of fancy stuff like Bass boosted, etc. Thus giving user the control to equalize their songs.

7. Bluetooth Connectivity is alright, only once out of a week did it struggle to connect to my phone but still whenever I turn on my bluetooth pairs up quickly.

8. Take occassional breaks while using this as earcups are big enough to cover the hollow parts of your ear at the same time fitting perfectly on top of my skeletal structures thus creating pain with continous usage."
5.0,6 September 2025,Very good sound very nice voice
2.0,30 August 2025,"I bought noise 2 and its build quality is worse, it broke while adjusting to my head üò§. But the sound quality is good"
5.0,23 August 2025,Its too good i like it because in headphones there fm memory and with aux and Bluetooth compulsory but i will the quality of sound and the worthy not a waste of money
2.0,18 August 2025,"Stupid headphones and brand,  I've just use this headphones for 3 months, it already stopped working, it's power button , volume buttons, stopped working , I even tried to file a complaint, but it's not submitting"
4.0,2 June 2025,All functions working
3.0,6 May 2025,Headphones are good sound and call quality is clear and comfortable for wear for long hours. Build quality needs to be improvement and the earcup needs more cushioning.
5.0,26 August 2025,"For the price range, the best quality headphone you could ever get. Trust me, it will be a good investment"
5.0,28 August 2025,Nice .. working perfectly after approx 2years of use.. FM playing is somewhat tricky..but perfect
4.0,10 February 2024,
4.0,6 March 2025,"i thing its the best in its price....... Awesome product . verified purchase but one thing that I may complain is that you can't use it continuously for more that 2 hours as your ears start to pain and make discomfort.
design good
mic quality ok ok
sound quality good at 60 - 70 % volume at 100% volume there is leakage of sound
weight distribution is good but it is not water resistant so make a distance with water"
4.0,26 May 2025,Mic not good
4.0,28 January 2024,"So, I got these headphones delivered 3 days ago and I have been using them 5hours everyday since then. Here are my views-
1.The build quality is decent. But, there are marks of My fingerprints on body. Also, the cushions are really good and these headphones are on ear not over ears one.
2. Battery life has been decent and due to type c port availability, it charges at decent speed.
3. Talking about comfort so my head and ears are big so these are not very comfortable but you can still wear them for around 1 hour and take break of 10 min after that. It is I think mainly designed for small ears.
4. Now, sound quality and bass has been very solid for this price range.
5. The biggest concern is noise leaking. After 50% you cannot go without making someone who is near you listen the song you are listening but for online classes and shows, voice leaking starts at 60-65%.
Overall, these are decent headphones not for someone like me who has big ears, and if you want to purchase headphones without noise leaking then go with any other brand than noise.
Forgot to mention that the quality of mic is okish and needs improving and sound canceling and anc is decent too not best.
If you are getting a deal for 1300 or 1500 then purchase these.
üëã bye"

4.0,16 July 2024,"I did purchased this earphone, and I love the bluetooth range, and I love earphone and the sound. At last, I have to return the product due to some defects, which I wish it's not there.

The functionality and sound and everything else is good, except, there's some part moving inside the right ear cup. May be loose speaker. When I move my head wearing it, it moves and give a grinding sound, and since it's on the ear, it's very loud. It's a manufacturing defect (of course) but not electronically.

I want a replacement, but they can't do that, and I have the option for refund only.

I still want it now also, but I get another brand, instead. I believe that's an isolated incident. Go for it."

4.0,21 December 2023,"really liked the design but there is so much noise leakage
Edit - this is my review after 1.5 years sound is good in a noisy environment you may want it to be a bit louder and big issue was noise leakage at max volume however i wanted it for gym so it was fine because gym noise cancels the leakage . bought it for 1700 ig now it‚Äôs for 1300 which is a steal they look good sound good easy to carry and crazy battery life just charge and forget. also one side stopped working in just 2-3 months so i called the customer service and they repaired it free of cost no questions asked as it was in warranty but you may want to consider that and biggest issue was the build quality after 6-7 months one of the hinge got broken so i glued it but after another 7 months other side of headphone gave a big crack out of nowhere which isn‚Äôt repair able so they are no more ,one thing for sure they won‚Äôt last you more than a year"

2.0,6 August 2025,It's heavy. Not comfortable
3.0,9 December 2023,"1. Sound quality is good.
2. Bass quality is also good.
3. Battery backup is superb.
4. Charging is also fast (not too fast but yeah, fast) and type-C port is a good addition.
5. Buttons are tactile and good so you won't have any problems with that.
6. Matte finish on the surface feels premium but it gets fingerprint smudges so try to keep it clean.
7. SD-card slot and aux support is appreciable.
8. Not durable because it is completely built with plastic, a little amount of metal is used at sides (under elongated part) so if you sleep while wearing it, then only God can save it.
9. After sometime, the points from where it collapses/folds gets loosened up, and you won't be able to jog while wearing it because of its loose fitting.
10. It is a good option at Rs. 1500, if its priced higher then look for other options."

I suggest to go for it under 1500.

3.0,4 February 2024,"Bought it for the inbuilt FM functionality (which doesn't work well to be honest). Rest is fine, BT connectivity dropped a lot the first day but now it is fine. It is too loud though, the lowest volume is not low enough. Treble is quite good but bass frequencies have issues. Comfort-wise it beats even high-end headphones. I am a sucker for light-weight headphones and these are the second-lightest ones I have ever worn. The ear cups are fine as well. They could have made them broader and this would have had the over-ear name. It also cancels a bit of noise physically. No ANC of course. I was about to return it after the first day but kept it anyway and don't regret. Good little headphones."

4.0,16 November 2022,"Decent headphone. You will not go wrong with this.Not recommended for hot weather or if you ear sweat a lot.
Else recommended for the price. I purchased at 1.5K

Sound quality is good. Very good for listening to YouTube videos, movies etc. Also good for songs.

(Edit: after 2 weeks use)
Tested in iPhone 14 Pro, Redmi K20 Pro, and my PC (aux cable). Everything works totally fine.
Haven't tried SD card playback (I don't need to).
Related to calls (didn't test), i do not prefer over the ear headphones for calls, so i have a alternative neckband for calls. So can't comment on that.

But i would recommend not to go with white like me. This is like pure white. So any small dirt or scratch will get noticed easily. Go for darker colours unless white is necessary.

Build is nice and doesn't feel cheap.

honestly very good deal for 1.5K not gonna lie.

And let me be super clear, this is NOT A BIASED or paid REVIEW. Pure based on usage."
